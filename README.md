This is a first attempt at monte carlo analysis for a stock price.
This project is under development, and will be regularly updated as the project progresses.

The goal for this project is to develop three functional codes:
1. A basic monte carlo simulation tool
2. A more advanced assistant tool that can be used in conjunction with the first code to idealize simulation parameters for more valuable and truthful insights.
3. A final, almost combinatory monte carlo tool that allows for quantitative input to add in a rebound effect to a monte carlo simulation. This allows a user with previously developed predictions about future market conditions to input them here and more accurately predict a future stock price with changing market conditions.

All three of these pieces are useful tools that help make more accurate predictions on future market value through times of economic uncertainty.
